# Ruby for Doers

Looking to start building application, scripts, or something awesome with Ruby? **Ruby for Doers**
is an excellent resource for simple code examples and explanations that aim to be concise and require
as little pre-requisite knowledge as possible.

Want to learn about the different data types? Hop right in.
Looking for more information about how to use modules? Great!

## First steps

*I am still in the process of determining the best order and way to work through the examples.
In the meantime, you can follow the steps below to try some of them out manually.*

Clone this repository. (Optionally, you can fork this repository so you can play around more
with the examples.)

`git clone git@github.com:kdaigle/ruby-for-doers.git`

Make sure you're in the directory you just cloned.

`cd ruby-for-doers`

Run any of the example files to see the output. Then, read the file to learn.

`ruby hello-world.rb`

I also highly recommend copying the code manually by reading from the site and typing it into
a folder locally. It's a great way to learn by doing.

## Goals

I'm trying to build the resource I would have wanted when I started with Ruby. My goals are:

* Keep each example file as self contained as possible.
* Limit the use of jargon. When required, attempt to explain it's meaning and/or link to a better
  resource that explains it's meaning.
* Each example file should be readable/executable in just a few minutes but files may build on
  previous ones.
* Keep a certain tone within examples. Not all examples will be as optimized, concise, or otherwise
  "perfect".

I got my inspiration for this by the excellent [Go By Example](http://www.gobyexample.com).
