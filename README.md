# Ruby for Doers

Looking to start building application, scripts, or something awesome with Ruby? **Ruby for Doers**
is an excellent resource for simple code examples and explanations that aim to be concise and require
as little pre-requisite knowledge as possible.

Want to learn about the different data types? Hop right in.
Looking for more information about how to use modules? Great!

## Goals

I'm trying to build the resource I would have wanted when I started with Ruby. My goals are:

* Keep each example file as self contained as possible.
* Limit the use of jargon. When required, attempt to explain it's meaning and/or link to a better
  resource that explains it's meaning.
* Each example file should be readable/executable in just a few minutes but files may build on
  previous ones.
* Keep a certain tone within examples. Not all examples will be as optimized, concise, or otherwise
  "perfect".

I got my inspiration for this by the excellent [Go By Example](http://www.gobyexample.com).
